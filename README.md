REAL TIME STOCK MARKET DATA ENGINEERING PROJECT

INTRODUCTION:

In this project, I executed an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.

Since the API is paid, I generated data using Python and Jupyter Notebook to replicate how real-time data looks. I used various technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
